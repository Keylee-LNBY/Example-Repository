# Git & GitHub Notes
Notes, shortcuts, & random information I'd like to remember. 

# Best Practices
When naming a Repo use all lowercase & put dashes in between words

# Command Line Shortcuts (I have Windows & use Bash)
pwd = shows the path you are in 
cd ~/ or cd ./ to create a path
git version = shows the version you are using and if it is installed
When you first set up and install your Git run these commands
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email"
git config --global --list = will list your configs

'git status' is a good way to see if your directory is clean
